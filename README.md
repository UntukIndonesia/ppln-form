# Public-facing services template

Template for bootstrapping new projects, especially for public-facing services.

This template bootstraps [@kbridenhaag/kbridh-app](https://github.com/kbridenhaag/kbridh-app).

You can extend its options using the documentation provided on the kbridh-app repository.

## Development

Start the development environment using `npm run dev`.
